# Real-Time Inventory Management System

##  Introduction
In modern inventory management systems, maintaining real-time updates across multiple clients can be a challenge, especially with traditional client-server architectures that rely on periodic polling. This project addresses the need for instant inventory synchronization and efficient data handling by leveraging Svelte for dynamic UI updates, Flask with WebSockets for real-time communication, and DuckDB for lightweight, high-performance data storage.

The Real-Time Inventory Management System provides a seamless solution where users can add, update, and delete products, with changes instantly reflected on all connected clients. This approach ensures data consistency, reduces latency, and enhances user experience, making it ideal for businesses that require real-time inventory tracking and management.
